Here are my new solutions. (I have about 2000 more candidate new solutions, but I haven't developed the tools yet to judge them. Probably about 6 will be real solutions.) 

Angles 45-270-22.5-112.5-90, four sides equal. This forms only one pattern. 
 
Angles 100-140-60-160-80, all sides equal. The tile and its mirror image are required for this tiling. I just learned the circle is called a "Hisrchhorn Medallion", and was first found by Mike Hirschhorn in the 1970's. I tiled the floor of my half bath with this tiling. 
 
Angles 108-36-252-36-108, all sides equal. This is easy to derive from a pentagram. It forms many interesting tilings. I've seen it in some of David Eppstein's tilings, so I didn't find it first. I painted it on the ceiling of my half bath. 
 
Angles 60-90-150-30-210, all sides equal. It would be easy to lay floor tiles or linoleum made with this.
